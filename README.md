# ArgumentEngineArgument


## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a means of recording and working with arguments in a well-defined manner in order to allow better understanding of individual arguments and how various arguments are related. This is accomplished through modeling the structure of formal arguments and allowing users to create their own arguments and rebuttals as well as tracking their opinions of the arguments.
